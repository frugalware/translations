msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:41
msgid ""
"Briefly: simplicity, multimedia, design. We try to make Frugalware as simple "
"as possible while not forgetting to keep it comfortable for the user. We try "
"to ship fresh and stable software, as close to the original source as "
"possible, because in our opinion most software is the best as is, and "
"doesn't need patching."

#: ../about.php:43
msgid ""
"That's two questions. Most software included in Frugalware have a GPL or BSD "
"compatible license, for more information about a license of a specific "
"package, refer to the LICENSE or COPYRIGHT file in the source tarball of the "
"package. On the other hand, the part written by our team (FrugalBuild "
"scripts, setup, homepage, etc) is released under GPL license. To make it "
"even more complicated, some parts of the setup and init scripts are written "
"by Patrick J. Volkerding. We GPL our additions, but Patrick J. Volkerding's "
"code is still under the BSD license. For more information, refer to the "
"COPYRIGHT file in the root directory of the FST (Frugalware Source Tree)."

#: ../about.php:45
msgid ""
"We don't have our own package manager, we use Judd Vinet's great work, the "
"<a href=\"http://www.archlinux.org/pacman\">pacman</a> package manager. It's "
"a tar.bz2 based package manager, similar to Slackware's .tgz. Our packages' "
"extension is .fpm to differentiate them from regular tarballs. Unlike "
"Slackware's scripts, pacman is written in C, so it's much faster."

msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:47
msgid ""
"We don't have any standalone program for updating packages as pacman manages "
"this task too. To update your package database, use <tt>pacman&nbsp;-Sy</"
"tt>, and to update your packages according the just synchronized package "
"database, you use <tt>pacman&nbsp;-Su</tt>. To install a package with the "
"necessary dependencies directly from a mirror ftp server, you issue "
"<tt>pacman&nbsp;-S&nbsp;foo</tt>. For more information, refer to the pacman "
"man page."

"Get involved! :) If you installed Frugalware from CDs, get the full FST via "
"repoman, which is available in pacman-tools. The sources are included in the "
"DVD edition. Then start to play with the FrugalBuild scripts, for a typical "
"example, refer to the <a href=\"/packages/44\">cabextract</a> package. Try "
"to improve them, or write a new one for a currently unsupported program. "
"Then send your patches to the <a href=\"mailman/listinfo/frugalware-devel"

"In short, what they want to, if they play a square game. They may maintain "

"FrugalBuild scripts to work correctly against a newer version. They can "
"contribute a new build script to a previously non-existent package. They can "
"write articles about Frugalware, or anything else in connection with the "
"Frugalware community. If you only want to help us, but you don't want to "
